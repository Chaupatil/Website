          Hello! Iâ€™m Jishnue, a high school student with a profound interest in
          machine learning and computer vision. My journey began in elementary
          school, where I was captivated by the complexities of mathematics and
          programming. Since then, I've advanced through rigorous academic
          challenges, including a machine learning certification from Stanford
          University where I scored 97%, and speaking at a TEDx event. My goal
          is to leverage technology to create solutions that make a meaningful
          difference in people's lives.
